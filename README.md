# angular-swipe-drawer

Keep each 'solution' in a separate folder

Keep the appearance as similar as possible to existing solutions


## Pure CSS - Open drawer disables address bar retraction

Suffers from inability to retract or show the address bar while the drawer is open.



## JS setting height of wrapper === window.innerHeight + Xpx (need to make demo)

Suffers from content 'snapping' to top when the wrappers height changes.

Possibly rectified by giving it's children a negative top margine / top value? Getting kind of hacky again though
