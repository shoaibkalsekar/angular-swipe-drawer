# angular-swipe-drawer

### Pure CSS
- Suffers from inability to retract or show the address bar while the drawer is open.

### Wrapper using window.height
- Suffers from content 'snapping' to top when the wrappers height changes.
- Little buggy overall
- Possibly rectified by giving it's children a negative top margin / top value? Getting kind of hacky again though
